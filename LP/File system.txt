=> linux uses / but windows uses \
=> linux also cares about capitalization
   In linux file can also be like Filename filename fileName
   where as in windows it can't be like this Filename filename fileName if we try to save those files then it asks to replace existing file

Linux File Hierarchy Structure (FHS)

1. / (Root): Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy. 
 



Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
The only root user has the right to write under this directory
/root is the root user’s home directory, which is not the same as /

2. /bin : 
	-> shortform for binaries
	-> Contains binary executables
	-> Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp

3. /sbin
	-> shortform for system binaries
	-> Just like /bin, /sbin also Contains binary executables
	-> The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.
	-> Also system binaries which are used by system administrator will use & standard user can't have access without permission

-> both of thes /bin & /sbin folders contain the files that need to be accessible when running single user mode
-> single user mode is something like it boots you as a root user to allow you to do repairs,upgrade or testing, networking is usually disabled in this mode because of security issues.
-> When you install a program it typically not placed in these folders

3. /boot :
	-> It contains everything that our OS needs to boot
	-> boot loaders are present here

4. /dev :
	-> This is where our devices live
	-> These include all the devices that are attached to the system.
	-> like it contains about keyboard, mouse, disk, drivers etc

5. /etc : 
	-> short form for edit to configure
	-> All the configurations are stored under this folder which required by all programs.
	-> This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.

6. /home :
	-> Users’ home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.
	-> Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
	-> example: /home/kishlay, /home/neeraj

7. /lib, /lib32, /lib64 :
	-> These are where the libraries are stored
	-> libraries such as static, dynamic libraries are stored
	-> Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
8. /media :
	-> Mount points for removable media such as CD, USB, floppy Disk
	->

9. /mnt :
	-> If you are mounting the directories manually then mount in this directory and leave /media directory that can be managed by OS
	-> Temporarily mounted filesystems.

10. /opt :
	-> This is optional folder
	-> manually installed s/w will be stored here from vendor resides
	-> This is also if you install s/w that you have created

11. /proc :
	-> It contains all the pseudo files
	-> It contains all details about system processes
	-> Every process has a directory so all the details of that particular process will be maintained with their process id

12. /root :
	-> It is the root users home folder
	-> If you want to store folders in this directory then you need permissions to access

13. /srv :
	-> It is the service directory where service data is stored
	-> Contains server specific services related data.

14. /tmp :
	-> It is a temporary directory
	-> This is where files are temporarily stored by apps such as session related data
	-> Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.
15. /usr :
	-> This is the user application space where apps will be installed
