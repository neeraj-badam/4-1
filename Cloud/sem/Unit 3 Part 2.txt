OCC : Open Cloud Consortium
-> OCC is
	=> A Not for profit
	=> Manages and operates cloud computing infrastructure to support
	   scientific, medical, health care and environmental research.
-> OCC members span the globe and include over 10
   universities, over 15 companies, and over 5 government
   agencies and national laboratories.
-> The OCC is organized into several different working groups.
-> The purpose of the OCC is to support the development of
   standards for cloud computing and to develop a
   framework for interoperability among various clouds.
-> The OCC supports the development of benchmarks for cloud
   computing.
-> Manages cloud computing testbeds, such as the Open Cloud
   Testbed, to improve cloud computing software and services.
-> Sponsors workshops and other events related to cloud computing
   to educate the community.

Standards for Application Developers

-> The purpose of application development standards
   is to ensure uniform, consistent, high-quality
   software solutions.
-> Programming standards help to improve the
   readability of the software, allowing developers to
   understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
-> Commonly used application standards are
   available for the Internet in browsers, for
   transferring data, sending messages, and securing data.
   
   Standards for Browsers (Ajax) :
	-> AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), is a
	group of interrelated web development techniques
	used to create interactive web applications or rich
	Internet applications
	-> Using Ajax, web applications can retrieve data from
	the server asynchronously, without interfering with
	the display and behavior of the browser page
	currently being displayed to the user
	-> The use of Ajax has led to an increase in interactive
	animation on web pages.
	-> Using Ajax, a web application can request only the
	content that needs to be updated in the web pages. This 
	greatly reduces networking bandwidth usage and page
	load times. 
	-> Sections of pages can be reloaded individually.
	-> An Ajax framework helps developers to build dynamic
	web pages on the client side. Data is sent to or from 
	the server using requests, usually written in JavaScript.
	->  ICEfaces is an open source Ajax framework developed
	as Java product and maintained by http://icefaces.org.
	ICEfaces Ajax Application Framework :
	1. ICEfaces is an integrated Ajax application 
	framework that enables Java EE application 
	developers to easily create and deploy thin-client 
	rich Internet applications in pure Java.
	2.To run ICEfaces applications, users need to 
	download and install the following products:
	● Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition
	● Ant
	● Tomcat
	● ICEfaces
	● Web browser (if you don’t already have one installed)
	-> ICEfaces is the one of the most secure Ajax
	solutions available. 
	-> It is Compatible with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
	protocol
	-> It prevents cross-site scripting, malicious code
	injection, and unauthorized data mining. 
	-> ICEfaces does not expose application logic or user
	data.
	-> It is effective in preventing fake form submits and
	SQL (Structured Query Language) injection attacks.
	-> write about XML AND JSON
	-> JSON :  Its main application
	is in Ajax web application programming, where
	it serves as an alternative to the XML format.
	Popular : LAPP > LAMP
	-> Many consider the LAPP stack a more secure
	out-of-the-box solution than the LAMP stack.

Standards for Messaging :

-> A message is a unit of information that is moved
   from one place to another
-> Most common messaging standards used in the cloud
are
	1. Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
	2. Post Office Protocol (POP)
	3. Internet Messaging Access Protocol (IMAP)
	4. Syndication (Atom, Atom Publishing Protocol,
and RSS)
	5. Communications (HTTP, SIMPLE, and XMPP)

SMTP :
-> Simple Message Transfer Protocol is arguably the most
   important protocol in use today for basic messaging. Before
   SMTP was created, email messages were sent using File
   Transfer Protocol (FTP).
-> The FTP protocol was designed to transmit files, not
   messages, so it did not provide any means for recipients to
   identify the sender or for the sender to designate an intended
   recipient.
-> SMTP was designed so that sender and recipient information
   could be transmitted with the message
-> SMTP is a two-way protocol that usually operates using TCP
   port 25.
POP :
-> SMTP can be used both to send and receive messages, but
   the client must have a constant connection to the host to
   receive SMTP messages.
-> The Post Office Protocol (POP) was introduced to
   circumvent this situation.
-> POP is a lightweight protocol whose single purpose is to
   download messages a server. This allows a server to
   store messages until a client connects and requests them. 
-> Once the client connects, POP servers begin to download
   the messages and subsequently delete them from the server
   in order to make room for more messages.
IMAP :
-> Once mail messages are downloaded with POP, they are
   automatically deleted from the server when the download
   process has finished.
-> Many businesses have compulsory compliance guidelines that
   require saving messages. It also becomes a problem if users
   move from computer to computer or use mobile networking,
   since their messages do not automatically move where they go.
-> To get around these problems, a standard called Internet
   Messaging Access Protocol was created. IMAP allows
   messages to be kept on the server but viewed and manipulated
   as though they were stored locally.
Syndication :
-> In general, syndication is the supply of material
   for reuse and integration with other material,
   often through a paid service subscription.
-> The most common example of syndication is in
   newspapers, where such content as wire-service
   news, comics, columns, horoscopes, and
   crossword puzzles are usually syndicated content.
-> Newspapers receive the content from the content
   providers, reformat it as required, integrate it with
   other copy, print it, and publish it
-> Atom is an XML-based document format that
   describes lists of related information known as
   "feeds".
-> Feeds are composed of a number of items, known
   as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached
   meta-data. For example, each entry has a title. 
-> The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) is an 
   applicationlevel protocol for publishing and editing 
   Web resources. 
-> RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication
-> RSS allows you to syndicate your site content
-> RSS files can be automatically updated
-> RSS allows personalized views for different sites
-> RSS is written in XML
-> RSS was designed to show selected data.
-> Without RSS, users will have to check your site daily for
   new updates. This may be too time-consuming for many
   users. With an RSS feed they can check your site faster using
   an RSS aggregator

Standards for Security
-> Security standards define the processes,
   procedures, and practices necessary for
   implementing a secure environment that provides
   privacy and security of confidential information in
   a cloud environment.
-> Security protocols, used in the cloud are
   1.Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
   2.Open Authentication (Oauth)
   3.OpenID
   4.SSL/TLS

Security Assertion Markup Language : (SAML)
-> SAML is an XML-based standard for communicating
   authentication, authorization, and attribute information among online
   partners. It allows businesses to securely send assertions between
   partner organizations regarding the identity and entitlements of a
   principal.
-> SAML is designed for business-to-business (B2B) and
   business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.
-> SAML is built on a number of existing standards, namely, SOAP,
   HTTP, and XML. SAML relies on HTTP as its communications
   protocol and specifies the use of SOAP.
-> Most SAML transactions are expressed in a standardized form of
   XML. SAML assertions and protocols are specified using XML
   schema.

Open Authentication (Oauth)
-> OAuth is an open protocol, initiated by Blaine
   Cook and Chris Messina, to allow secure API
   authorization in a simple, standardized method
   for various types of web applications.
-> OAuth is a method for publishing and
   interacting with protected data.
-> OAuth provides users access to their data while
   protecting account credentials.
-> OAuth by itself provides no privacy at all and
   depends on other protocols such as SSL to
   accomplish that.

OpenID
-> OpenID is an open, decentralized standard for user
   authentication and access control that allows users to
   log onto many services using the same digital identity.
-> It is a single-sign-on (SSO) method of access control.
-> It replaces the common log-in process (i.e., a log-in
   name and a password) by allowing users to log in
   once and gain access to resources across participating
   systems.
-> An OpenID is in the form of a unique URL and is
   authenticated by the entity hosting the OpenID URL.

SSL/TLS
-> Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure
   Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographically secure protocols
   designed to provide security and data integrity for
   communications over TCP/IP
-> TLS and SSL encrypt the segments of network connections
   at the transport layer.
-> TLS provides endpoint authentication and data
   confidentiality by using cryptography.
-> TLS involves three basic phases:
   1.Peer negotiation for algorithm support
   2.Key exchange and authentication
   3.Symmetric cipher encryption and message authentication
