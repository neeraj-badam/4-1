Cloud computing :
Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster
innovation and flexible resources.

Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing :
-> Users are not tied to a specific device
-> Users have location independence
-> Users can use cloud any time
-> Multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs among a large pool of users.
-> Reliability is enhanced due to use of multiple redundant sites by service providers.
-> Dynamically scalable cloud services based on changing user demands.
-> Access to cloud is usually logged to enforce security
-> Cloud computing is likely to bring supercomputing capacity to the masses.

Advantages of Cloud Computing :
-> Lower computer costs :
	* ) You do not need a high-powered and high-priced computer to run cloud computing's web-based applications.
	* ) Since applications run in the cloud, not on the desktop PC, your desktop PC does not need the processing power or hard disk space demanded
	    by traditional desktop software.
	* ) When you are using web-based applications, your PC can be less expensive, with a smaller hard disk, less memory, more efficient processor.
	* ) In fact, your PC in this scenario does not even need a CD or DVD drive, as no software programs have to be loaded and no document files need to be saved.

-> Improved performance : 
	* ) Computers in a cloud computing system boot and run faster because they have fewer programs and processes loaded into memory

-> Reduced software costs
	* ) Instead of purchasing expensive software applications, you can get most of what you need at low cost.
	    Eg : most cloud computing applications today, such as the Google Docs suite.

-> Instant software updates
	* ) When the application is web-based, updates happen automatically available the next time you log into the cloud. 
	* ) When you access a web-based application, you get the latest version without needing to pay for or download an upgrade.

-> Improved document format compatibility.

-> Unlimited storage capacity
	* ) Cloud computing offers virtually Unlimited storage.
	* ) Your computer's current 1 Terabyte hard drive is small compared to the hundreds of Petabytes available in the cloud.

-> Increased data reliability
	* ) Unlike desktop computing, in which if a hard disk crashes and destroy all your valuable data, a computer crashing in the cloud should
	    not affect the storage of your data.
	* ) Provides data redundancy with high reliability.

-> Universal document access
	* ) That is not a problem with cloud computing, because you do not take your documents with you.
	* ) Instead, they stay in the cloud, and you can access them whenever you have a computer and an Internet connection
	* ) Documents are instantly available from wherever you are

-> Latest version availability
	* ) When you edit a document at home, that edited version is what you see when you access the document at work.
	* ) The cloud always hosts the latest version of your documents

-> Easier group collaboration
	* ) Sharing documents leads directly to better collaboration.
	* ) multiple users can collaborate easily on documents and projects

-> Device independence.
	* ) You can access the cloud from any portable device which has internet

Disadvantages of Cloud Computing :
-> Requires a constant Internet connection :
	* ) Cloud computing is impossible if you cannot connect to the Internet.
	* ) Since you use the Internet to connect to both your applications and documents,
	    if you do not have an Internet connection you cannot access anything, even your own documents.

-> Does not work well with low-speed connections :
	* ) Web-based applications require a lot of bandwidth to download, as do large documents.

-> Can be slow :
	* ) Even with a fast connection, web-based applications can sometimes be slower because of increase in number of users accessing the data.

-> Stored data might not be secure :
	* ) With cloud computing, all your data is stored on the cloud.

-> Stored data can be lost :
	* ) Theoretically, data stored in the cloud is safe, replicated across multiple machines.
