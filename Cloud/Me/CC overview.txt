-> Cloud computing is Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software and information are provided to computers and other devices on-demand,
   like the electricity grid.
-> This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.
-> Cloud Computing is very much involved with the software engineering term known as 'service'. A service is the endpoint of a connection.
   Also, a service has some type of underlying computer system that supports the connection offered.

Five Essential characteristics of CC :
	1.On-demand self-service :
		Customer can select the resources based on their needs and can upgrade/downgrade services at anytime.
		Customers can access the resources at any time and from anywhere.
	2.Broad network access :
		Customers can access the resources over the internet from any geographical location.
	3.Resource pooling : 
		Scale up/down based on the customer needs.
		achieve multi-tenancy
	4.Rapid elasticity : 
		The resources can scale elastically with demand based on the consumer needs.
	5.Measured service : 
		The resources used by the customer are done on a pay-per-use basis
		Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Three service models of CC :
1.Saas
	1. The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure 
	2. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email),
	   or a program interface.
	3. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, 
	   storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.
	-> It is an on-demand service
	-> It is an independent platform so we don't need to install in our pc/laptop
	-> Allows multi-tenancy
	Example for saas services :
		G-mail,Google drive,Google calendar,Google docx
	-> Most Application Program Interfaces (APIs) are associated with SaaS Cloud Providers.
	Advantages and Disadvantages :
		-> Universally accessible from any platform and anywhere
		-> Excellent for collaborative working
		-> Automatic updates are available on cloud infrastructure
		-> No need to manage any data and this is handled by cloud infrastructure
		-> Low network bandwith has low performance
2.Paas
	-> The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using 
	   programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. 
	-> The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, 
	   but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
	Example for paas services :
		Heroku,Microsoft Azure,Google app engine,force.com,now-a-days firebase also
	-> Instead of ready-made applications or services, PaaS provides the platform for developing such applications and services.
	Advantages and Disadvantages :
		-> You or your organization are responsible for the updating the software developed
		-> No need to provision servers. This is handled by the PaaS Cloud Provider.
		-> No need to manage the underlying data center. This is handled by the PaaS Cloud Provider.
		
3.Iaas
	-> The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the 
	   consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.
	-> The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed 
	   applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
	Example for Iaas services :
		Amazon web services,Ec2
	Advantages and Disadvantages :
		-> You or your organization are responsible for the versioning/upgrades of software developed
		-> Dynamic workload is supported
		-> It is flexible
